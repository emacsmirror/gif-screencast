#+TITLE: Emacs GIF Screencast

One-frame-per-action GIF recording for optimal quality/size ratio.

See [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-system-packages][Helm System Packages]] for examples.

* Rationale

Most Emacs screencasts are done by first recording a video, then converting it
to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF][GIF]].  It seems like a waste of resources considering the little animation
Emacs features.

Most of the time, one user action equals one visual change.  By exploiting this
fact, this package tailors GIF-screencasting for Emacs and captures one frame
per user action.  It's much more efficient than capturing frames even at a
frequency as low as 10 per second.  You could roughly expect 3 to 10 times
smaller files compared to videos of the same quality.  (Benchmarks are welcome.)

Conversely, should your Emacs demo feature self-animated content (such as output
scrolling in Eshell), no frame will be captured.  A workaround consists in
hammering some no-op key such as ~forward-char~ or ~end-of-line~.

Another neat perk of action-based captures is that it produces /editable/ GIF files:
programs such as [[https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/][Gifsicle]] or [[https://www.gimp.org/][The GIMP]] can be used to edit the delays or rearrange frames.

This is particularly useful to fix mistakes in "post-processing", without having
to record the demo all over again.

* Features, pros and cons

- Recordings can be paused and resumed.

- Resulting GIF files are editable, which allows for post-processing / fixing.

- Quality is top notch.

- File-size is optimal.

- The result might feel a tad jittery sometimes.

- It won't render self-animated content such as auto-scrolling, this is
  workable however.

- It should be much lighter on memory and CPU than video recording.

* Implementation

Upon start, it adds ~gif-screencast-capture~ to ~pre-command-hook~ which makes
every command (including those called by key presses) take a screenshot.  On
each screenshot, it records the timestamp.

If paused then resumed, the timestamps are offset by the length of the pause.

When stopped, it compiles the screenshots together into a GIF file using the
timestamps to set the appropriate delays for each frame.

* Setup

You'll need a screenshot program and a GIF converter.  Defaults are:

- ~gif-screencast-program~: [[http://scrot.sourcearchive.com/][scrot]]
- ~gif-screencast-convert-program~: [[https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert]] (from the ImageMagick suite)
- Optional: ~gif-screencast-optimize-program~: [[https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/][Gifsicle]]

You can pass arguments to the screenshot program via ~git-screencast-args~ to
command it to capture only part of the screen, e.g. you can restrict the capture
to the Emacs frame with =scrot='s argument =--focused=

You might want to set some bindings for convenience.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'gif-screencast
  (define-key gif-screencast-mode-map (kbd "<f8>") 'gif-screencast-toggle-pause)
  (define-key gif-screencast-mode-map (kbd "<f9>") 'gif-screencast-stop))
#+END_SRC

Start recording with ~gif-screencast~!

Alternatively, you can bind =gif-screencast-start-or-stop= to a global key:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<f9>") 'gif-screencast-start-or-stop)
#+end_src

** macOS

macOS requires some additional settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'gif-screencast
  (setq gif-screencast-args '("-x")) ;; To shut up the shutter sound of `screencapture' (see `gif-screencast-command').
  (setq gif-screencast-cropping-program "mogrify") ;; Optional: Used to crop the capture to the Emacs frame.
  (setq gif-screencast-capture-format "ppm") ;; Optional: Required to crop captured images.
#+END_SRC

[[https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php][mogrify]] is part of the ImageMagick suite.

** HiDPI screens

On HiDPI screens the result may be incorrectly cropped.
Set ~gif-screencast-scale-factor~ to the scale factor of your screen to fix this.

** Wayland

There aren't many CLI screenshot programs that support Wayland.
Here is an example configuration that works with [[https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot][Flameshot]].

First, create a small =flameshot_bash= bash script like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/sh
flameshot full -r>"$1"
#+END_SRC

Then configure like so to use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq gif-screencast-program "flameshot_bash")
(setq gif-screencast-args '())
#+END_SRC


** Display pressed keys while recording

The [[https://github.com/tarsius/keycast][KeyCast]] package is useful to display the pressed keys in the modeline while recording.

* Troubleshooting

** Process 'convert' aborted (core dumped)

It's possible that your ImageMagick installation has a too limited "disk
resource" policy.  See the output of

#+begin_src sh
convert -list resource
#+end_src

Setting it to a high enough value like 10Â GiB in =/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml=
should fix it.

See https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/396 for more details on
this issue.
